# Django Course

A Django course.

## Introduction

This course is for programmers...or not.
For those who know Django...or do not.

Through this course you will learn a little bit about web servers, web frameworks and other cool stuff.

## What will you learn?

You will learn a lot of new concepts (if you are a new web programmer) here. Most of them are attached to any web framework so your knowledge will be used outside of Django too.

## What will you be able to make?

Anything.
After the course you will be able to improve your search about how to make new components and plug them into your app.
Here are some good apps you can try to develop to test your Django programming skills:

* Blog system
* News portal
* Website
* Your-cool-app-that-does-a-lot-of-stuff
