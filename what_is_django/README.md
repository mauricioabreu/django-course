# What is Django?

Django is a free and open-source web framework written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

It is a web framework which comes with a lot of good componentes that are very useful when building a website. Some of these components are visible to you (signing in, signing up, registration, profile navigation, forms) and others are only visible to administrators (admin interface, management panel and internal dashboards).
